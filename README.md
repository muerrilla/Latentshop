# Image Editor

The Image Editor is a tool that allows you to adjust the color, brightness, and contrast of your images. With separate commands for each parameter, you can easily fine-tune your images to achieve the desired result.

## Installation

To install the Image Editor, simply download the latest release from the "Releases" page of this repository.

## Usage

To use the Image Editor, follow these steps:

1. Open the editor and load the image you want to adjust.
2. Use the `color` command to adjust the color balance of the image. This command takes three parameters: `red`, `green`, and `blue`. For example, to increase the red color in your image, you can use the following command: `color red +10`.
3. Use the `brightness` command to adjust the overall brightness of the image. This command takes a single parameter: `value`. For example, to increase the brightness of your image by 10%, you can use the following command: `brightness +10`.
4. Use the `contrast` command to adjust the contrast of the image. This command takes a single parameter: `value`. For example, to increase the contrast of your image by 20%, you can use the following command: `contrast +20`.
